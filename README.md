# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Fuzzy-Control
In this project, the DDPG based reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to improve the fuzzy model based control system subject to nonlinearity and uncertainty. 

The file "Training of the RL agent.ipynb" is used to train the RL agent through DDPG.

The file "Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzy Control" uses (loads) the well-trained RL agent to optimize the performance of the fuzzy-model-based control system.
